    "content": "pork is like an alternative universe version of me the version of myself that speaks to me if 16 year old me could speak to me now.\n I work at a golf course to understand rich people; I do debate i out aura them; im leagues beyond my peers; im persistent and smart from a young age; etc;\n if you dont need people than stop needing them\n as edward put it 'dont really on the sunk cost fallacy'.\n this is simple shit i do know but i forget a lot. but again dont be too hard on yourself. consistent effort is 100 times more powerful than a single larger push"

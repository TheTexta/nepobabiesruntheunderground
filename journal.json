    "content": "pork is like an alternative universe version of me the version of myself that speaks to me if 16 year old me could speak to me now.\n I work at a golf course to understand rich people; I do debate i out aura them; im leagues beyond my peers; im persistent and smart from a young age; etc;\n if you dont need people than stop needing them\n as edward put it 'dont really on the sunk cost fallacy'.\n this is simple shit i do know but i forget a lot. but again dont be too hard on yourself. consistent effort is 100 times more powerful than a single larger push"

    "quote of the day": "constraints are more powerful than goals",
    "content": "antigoals are as important if not more important than goals. people work better when they work freely within a constrained system rather than in a single direction. its impossible to know where to go in an ever evolving world so constraints - even if artificial and arbitrary allow for more novel solutions to emerge than the hyper specificity of a single goal"

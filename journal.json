    "content": "antigoals are as important if not more important than goals. people work better when they work freely within a constrained system rather than in a single direction. its impossible to know where to go in an ever evolving world so constraints - even if artificial and arbitrary allow for more novel solutions to emerge than the hyper specificity of a single goal"

(he didnt say that exactly but im approximating what he said)' I think its important that I learn to stop overanalysisng my state internally and start observing from an external view. 'the easiest way to stop depersonalisation is to stop researching depersonalisation' 'stop thinking in the mindset of better luck next time and more in the mindset of i am built for this and not for this' 'the most successful founders are those who move quickly and continously have a drive to test new ideas; those who can think of new ideas frequently while also testing them do best.' i asked dave about the shopify founders advice 'work a hard job but not for too long that you become complacement; hire people in otawa they ahve nothing else to do' \nSources: https://www.instagram.com/p/DAoujD-S6BO/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-xjLSNdu2w&list=PLJ_iA72MtEwM-eGSMmAS59VcGK2P0hoKo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szKyUrOh4fs"
